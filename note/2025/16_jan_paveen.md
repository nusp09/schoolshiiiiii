# fetch decode execute cycle
- fetch - instructions loaded into ram, then each individual instruction is fecthed from the memory and placed into the apropriate register for the cpu to use
- decode - the boinary representationof the instruction needs to be translated into useable information before it can be run, the control unit does this and figures out what else needs to be done
- execute - once the istruction is understood ic can now be executed and the control unit will tell the other components what they need to do
e.g. encription / decription
