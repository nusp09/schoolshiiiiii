why do we compress stuff
we want to save space/storage
quicker download/upload speeds
lower bandwidth


lossy compression:
lossy compression is when you compress a file by getting rid of data this is an irreversable change
it perminantly deletes parts of data 
e.g.
  reducing the colour depth of an image
  reducing the resolution of an image
  lower the sample rate
  lower the sample resolution
it can be good if you remove things that humans cannot tell

compressed file types:
  image:
    jpeg
    png
  sound:
    wav
    mp3
  video
    mp4
    mov
  text
    bzip2
    gzip


lossless compression:
no data is lost when data is compressed 
however its not very effective for sound and lossy can coimpress to a smaller size
example:png




huffman encoding 
huffman is a method of lossles compression 
this is based on the frequency of data items
it uses a binary tree to organise the data

huffman encoding uses a binary tree where the nodes are the frequency of the letters and the tree expands the deeper you go the less likely the letter is to appearon the huffman binary tree a left edge is represented by a 0 and a right edge is represented as a 1
this means that the most frequent letters require less data to represent e.g.

abaracadabra

the letter a appears 6 times so would be the first left node as 6                    12

                                                                                  /      \
                                                                                6         6
                                                                                a
