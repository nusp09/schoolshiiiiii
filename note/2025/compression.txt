why do we compress stuff
we want to save space/storage
quicker download/upload speeds
lower bandwidth


lossy compression:
lossy compression is when you compress a file by getting rid of data this is an irreversable change
it perminantly deletes parts of data 
e.g.
  reducing the colour depth of an image
  reducing the resolution of an image
  lower the sample rate
  lower the sample resolution
it can be good if you remove things that humans cannot tell

compressed file types:
  image:
    jpeg
    png
  sound:
    wav
    mp3
  video
    mp4
    mov
  text
    bzip2
    gzip


lossless compression:
no data is lost when data is compressed 
however its not very effective for sound and lossy can coimpress to a smaller size
example:png
